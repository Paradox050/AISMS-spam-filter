AI-Powered SMS Spam Filter for A2P Messaging
This project is an intelligent, lightweight AI solution that classifies A2P (Application-to-Person) SMS messages into:
Spam
Promotional
Transactional

Built using Scikit-learn, FastAPI, and Docker, this project exposes a RESTful API and includes a whitelisting mechanism to bypass known safe senders such as trusted domains or OTP templates.

Model Used
Vectorizer: TfidfVectorizer
Classifier: Logistic Regression

Trained on: Labeled SMS dataset with categories (spam, transactional, promotional)

Whitelisting:
Before predicting a message category using the AI model, the system checks if the message contains any whitelisted terms such as:

Trusted domain names (trip.com, irctc, etc.)

Verified OTP message patterns

Internal shortcodes used by businesses

If a match is found, the message is immediately classified as transactional, regardless of the ML model‚Äôs output.

This adds a layer of safety and trust to the filtering mechanism, especially in high-volume enterprise use cases.
